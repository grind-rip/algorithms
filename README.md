## [Binary Search](./src/binary_search.py)
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted array.

## [Breadth-first Search (BFS)](./src/bfs.py)
Breadth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to nodes at the next depth level.

## [Cycle Detection](./src/cycle_detection.py)
Cycle detection or cycle finding is the algorithmic problem of finding a cycle in a sequence of iterated function values.

## [Depth-first Search (DFS)](./src/dfs.py)
Depth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking and traversing other nodes.

## [Quickselect](./src/quickselect.py)
Quickselect (also known as Hoare's selection algorithm) is a selection algorithm to find the kth smallest (or largest) element in an unordered list of n elements.

## [Quicksort](./src/quicksort.py)
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

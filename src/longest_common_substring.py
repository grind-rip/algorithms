Longest Common Substring
------------------------

The longest common substring is the longest substring that is common to two or
more strings. It can be found using a dynamic programming approach.

Definitions:
  * Substring: A contiguous sequence of characters that can be derived from
    another string.

Dynamic programming
-------------------
The dynamic programming solution is similar to the Longest Common Subsequence
solution, however, since substrings are inherently simpler than subsequences, the
implementation is also simpler.

We use a 2D array, dp, to store the length of the longest common suffix
(substring) of the prefixes a[0...i] and b[0...j], where i and j are the end
positions of the substrings for each respective string.

As with most dynamic programming problems, we define our base cases:

  1. If the length of `a` or `b` is 0, then the longest common substring has
     length 0.

  2. If a[i] == b[j], then the longest common substring is *at least* 1.
     However, if a[i - 1] and b[j - 1] denote the last characters of a common
     substring, use its length. This is represented programmatically with the
     following:

       dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1

The longest common substrings are represented by the maximum values in dp
located at the end positions for the substrings in `a` and `b`.

Unlike with the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm, the 2D array does not
build to a solution at dp[i][j]. Therefore, the length and indices of the
longest common substrings are maintained while iterating.

The dynamic programming approach has O(n x m) time complexity, however, with
the help of a generalized suffix tree, the time complexity is reduced to
O(n + m).
